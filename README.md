# Solutions to leetcode (algorithm part in c++)

I find leetcode modifying the input parameters of a solution from time to time, such as from array[] to vector, char* to string. So if you find a mismatch, let me know or you can simply do a little modification yourself! Also, if you find your solution is better than mine, let me know. Thank you!
