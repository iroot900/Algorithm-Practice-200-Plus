# Solutions to leetcode And More

I find leetcode modifying the input parameters of a solution from time to time, such as from array[] to vector, char* to string. So if you find a mismatch, let me know or you can simply do a little modification yourself! Also, if you find your solution is more efficient, readable than mine, I would love to learn from it. Thank you!
